# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.

  Analytics:
    Within the analytics section, officers have access to detailed insights categorized by various parameters such as police station, district, village, crime category, and timelines.        These analytics serve as invaluable tools for strategic decision-making, enabling law enforcement agencies to allocate resources effectively and respond proactively to emerging           trends or challenges.
Complementing these functionalities are dynamic visualization tools that make data interpretation interactive and engaging. These visualizations offer a deeper understanding of trends and patterns, facilitating data-driven decision-making and promoting transparency within the organization.
